install selenium bindings for javascript
install Node.js. Go to https://nodejs.org for download. Install both the node.js.runtime and the npm package manager.
install a javascript editor, e.g. Visual Studio Code
install selenium webdriver in the directory where your test scripts are located, e.g. npm install selenium-webdriver
install javascript test framework, e.g. Mocha, that defines the test structures and provides assertions or checks in the test scripts
install Mocha from command line: npm install -g mocha
This installs globally , that is, any Node.js project can use this module
Javascript Test script structure:
test.describe - Description of a collection of related test cases
test.it - Individual test case
Use assert module of Node.js to perform checks, e.g. assert.equal(...)
For more information on assert module go to: https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html
Mocha provides the hooks before(), after(), beforeEach(), and afterEach() 
which can be used to set up preconditions and clean up after test scripts, i.e. they are run before or after every test.
You now run the test script with mocha framework with mocha command at command line, make sure to change directory to location where test scripts are stored. e.g. mocha webpagetestXYZ.js
