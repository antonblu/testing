mobile testing can be directly through the android device or through an android emulator
To setup android emulator you need to download android studio which will already contain the needed package/files.
to install the app to be tested in the android emulator, you need the app's apk file and install from the command line
to test the app on a real android device, you need to enable the device for USB debugging then connect the device via USB and grant permission on the device to allow
your desktop to access the device.
once real device is connected, you can use uiautomatorviewer to take screenshots of the device screen or get the app elements
