Mobile testing can involve one of the following: Real Android/IOS device, Android emulator or Mobile website.
To setup android emulator you need to download Android studio which contains tools such as AVD Manager to create the emulator.
To install the app to be tested in the android emulator, you need the app's apk file that you will install from the command line
To test the app on a real android device, you need to enable the device for USB debugging then connect the device via USB and grant permission on the device that will allow your desktop to access the device.
Once the real android device is connected, you can use uiautomatorviewer to take screenshots of the device screen or get the app elements.
