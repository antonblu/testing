Selenium Tips:
to test Firefox automatically, you just need Selenium IDE
selenium IDE has firefox plugins to log errors or to create reports. It also has a feature to schedule the automated test at a certain time.
to test the app on chrome or IE, you need to download Selenium webdriver, and selenium browser drivers as well as python selenium bindings(if you are using python)
You use python to create the .py automation script in an editor like spyder.
you then run python .py script from the command line, e.g. python c:\users\some username\.spyder-py3\pytest1.py
