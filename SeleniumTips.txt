Selenium Tips:
To test Firefox automatically, you just need Selenium IDE
Selenium IDE has firefox plugins to log errors or to create reports. It also has a feature to schedule the
automated test at a certain time.
To test the app on chrome or IE, you need to download Stand-alone server, and the Selenium browser drivers 
as well as python selenium bindings(if you are using python)
Python is the language used to create .py automation scripts in an editor like Spyder.
You then run the python .py script from the command line using python,
e.g. python c:\users\some username\.spyder-py3\pytest1.py
