Jenkins is an automation server that is most useful for running a bunch of tests, e.g. sequentially running test
scripts one after the other.
Jenkins can be setup to run the tests at regular time intervals. 
Using Jenkins plugins, test results can be displayed and stored(archived) so we have a running history of the test
results.
Thus, Jenkins saves time for the tester.
